In my code, I have some commands to read the different datasets in to matlab, the datasets are: Data,Datamodify,Data2,Data3
Each time you can comment others and just read one data file.
Each time you can change start, stop, step to run different range of lambda.
The data is sent to Prof.
if you have questions to run code, please contact me at 512-577-1867.
I explain a lot in my code so you can see it very directly.
Finally. thanks for your help this semester and hope you and Prof. have a great summer.

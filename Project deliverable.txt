Project Deliverables
Project Deliverables:
 
1. Project Report: a pdf copy sent via email to pradeepr@cs.utexas.edu
 
2. Submit your code via
$ turnin --submit adarsh finalproject <filenames>
 
2a. Please have a README file detailing how to run the code, and be sure to remove any hardcoded dependencies relying on your local systems.
 
2b. If your data is less than 10 MB, and there are no privacy restrictions associated with the dataset, please turnin the data as well.
 
If it is more than 10MB, then please do not turnin the data.
 
If there is a public link to the dataset, please add this link and any further instructions to the README.
If it is more than 10MB and there is no public link to the data, be sure to make your code readable in this case, since we might have to resort to visual inspection of the code.

The deadline is Friday May 02, 11:59 PM. No slip days/extensions.
 
Project Report
The project report should have three key sections.
 
The first section, would have motivation + description of the problem + data + algorithms.
 
The second section would be on the execution + results. Describe any salient implementational details (e.g. three-fold cross-validation to select the regularization parameter, etc.), and then describe the results of applying the machine learning algorithm to the data/problem via graphs, tables, etc.
 
The last section would be on a discussion/analysis of your results. Here, imagine you are explaining the results to somebody who does not know machine learning, but who is nonetheless interested in any insights you might have obtained from your data analysis. For instance, what features were salient (due to a high-weight in regression), what ranges of features values does a particular cluster have, etc.
 
For grading, the relative weighting of these three sections would be 3/10 for the first, 5/10 for the second, and 2/10 for the third.

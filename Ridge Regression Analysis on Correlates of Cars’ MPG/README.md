In this research project, I focused on using ridge regression to analyze the correlations between carâ€™s MPG and a series of possible predictor variables.I used the ridge regression method to generate the most stable regression model with the best ridge
parameter. As my predictor variables I used number of cylinders, engine displacement, horsepower, weight of the vehicle, acceleration time, origin country and the year of the car. 

I used cross-validation to train and test the data. I obtained three different models by including in one all predictor variables and in the other two only categorical and continuous variables. Moreover, I also examed the benefits of using ridge regression instead of OLS regression model in this study. For more details and citations, plese read the reserach paper.
